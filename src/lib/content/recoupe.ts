	'Recoupe is a regenerative ecological project breathing new life into Troopers Hill Woods.  Our focus is to work sensitively with the land to create a thriving and diverse working woodland. We will mainly use hand tools and apply traditional woodland management techniques such as coppicing, charcoal burning, and hedge laying. This allows us to produce local products like: Beanpoles, pea sticks, Charcoal and Materials for traditional crafts, ensuring all parts of the tree are utilised.';
