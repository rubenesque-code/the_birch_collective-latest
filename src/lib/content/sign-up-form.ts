But if there was an extreme situation, like if you or someone else was at risk of being seriously hurt, then we would need to break confidentiality to keep you safe. If this happened we would discuss it with you first and do our best to make sure you were involved in any decisions that have to be made. We know this can be scary and you might not want us to share anything, but we will support you through the whole thing."
